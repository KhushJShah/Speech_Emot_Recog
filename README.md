# Speech Emotion Recognition Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) system using deep learning techniques. The primary goal is to identify human emotions through speech, leveraging variations in tone and pitch that often reveal emotional states. The project utilizes multiple datasets to train and evaluate various models, including CNN, LSTM, and a hybrid CNN+LSTM architecture.

## Guided by
- Prof. Yuxiao Huang

## Datasets Used
- [Crowd-sourced Emotional Mutimodal Actors Dataset (Crema-D)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ejlok1/cremad)
- [Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song (Ravdess)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uwrfkaggler/ravdess-emotional-speech-audio/data)
- [Surrey Audio-Visual Expressed Emotion (Savee)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ejlok1/surrey-audiovisual-expressed-emotion-savee)

## Model Performance
- **CNN Model:** Achieved the highest accuracy of 71.83%, showcasing its effectiveness in speech emotion recognition.
- **LSTM Model:** Yielded a lower accuracy of 32%, suggesting limitations in capturing complex temporal patterns.
- **CNN+LSTM Model:** Showed promise with an accuracy of 64.67%, indicating potential synergy between convolutional and recurrent networks.

## Future Research Directions
- **Refining Hybrid Architectures:** Focus on improving hybrid models to better leverage the strengths of both CNNs and LSTMs.
- **Advanced Techniques:** Explore advanced methods such as attention mechanisms and transfer learning to enhance model performance.
- **Dataset Augmentation:** Augment existing datasets with diverse speech samples and a wider range of emotions to improve model generalization and robustness.

## Practical Applications
- **Call Centers:** Implement SER to categorize calls based on emotional content, enhancing customer service by identifying unsatisfied customers and improving overall satisfaction.
- **Vehicle Systems:** Integrate SER into vehicle systems to monitor drivers' mental states, activating safety measures to potentially prevent accidents.

## Project Execution
The project was executed collaboratively by the team members under the guidance of Prof. Yuxiao Huang as part of the Machine Learning course (DATS 6202). The collective efforts and effective project management resulted in the development of a robust SER system with real-world applications.
